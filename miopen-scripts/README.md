## MIOpen-Scirpts.

These are generated files from miopen logs that are useful for training and inference.
- Train runs the script for both the forward and backward pass.
- Inference runs the script only for the forward path.

Note: 
Make sure to give BIN_DIR=<MIOpen-build>/bin/ and $OPTIONS variable for any additional information like batchsizes, iterations etc.
